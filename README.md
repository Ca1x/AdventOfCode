🎄 Advent of Code

This is my personal repository for solving Advent of Code
 puzzles.
It’s mainly for me — a place to practice, experiment, and track progress across different programming languages.

🗂️ What You’ll Find

💻 Multi-language solutions – C, C++, Python, and whatever else I feel like learning

🔄 Multiple takes on the same puzzle – sometimes a quick hack, sometimes a cleaner rewrite

🧩 Ongoing updates – I’m not uploading everything at once, just whenever I sit down with a puzzle

📚 Code evolution – early messy attempts stay alongside later refinements

🎯 Purpose

Practice algorithmic problem-solving 🧠

Explore different programming paradigms 🌐

Keep a record of how my coding style changes over time 📝

Have a dedicated space that feels like a second GitHub profile 🕹️
